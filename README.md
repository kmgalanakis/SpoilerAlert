# Spoiler Alert

Spoiler Alert is a Joomla Conten Plugin based on a [jQuery plugin](http://joshbuddy.github.io/spoiler-alert/) developed by [this guy](https://github.com/joshbuddy). 

As he says, don't spoil it! Hide copy and images with a bit of SVG blur. Taste on mouseover. Eat on click.

Do you publish spoilers? Do you wish you could have them on your page in a way that wasn't fucking rude? With Spoiler Alert! you can! Hide spoilers with a bit of blur.

But for Joomla. Also compatible with K2.

## Installation

Install using Joomla installation manager. Along with the content plugin, an Editor Button plugin will be installed.

## Uninstallation

Uninstalled using Joomla installation manager. Select to uninstall the content plugin alone. The editor button plugin will also be uninstalled.

## Usage

Use by inserting the shortcode in your content (article or K2 item) or in your module (keep in mind that you have to enable "Prepare Content" in your module settings).

The shortcode should be like:

* [spoiler]This is spoiler text![/spoiler]
* [spoiler max="50"]This is spoiler text![/spoiler]
* [spoiler partial="5" max="10"]This is spoiler text![/spoiler]

Or just use the Editor Button below the editor area.
